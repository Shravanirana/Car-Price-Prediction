# Car-Price-Prediction
🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the price of a car based on its specifications using machine learning models. It helps users and sellers estimate a car’s value more accurately.

📌 Project Overview
Predicting car prices based on features like make, model, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and transmission helps in pricing used cars accurately. This project uses regression algorithms trained on a dataset of car listings to provide estimated prices.
